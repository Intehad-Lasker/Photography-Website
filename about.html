            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Bazz</strong>, a passionate photographer who loves capturing the beauty of the world through my lens. 
               While photography is just a hobby for me, itâ€™s a creative escape that allows me to explore different perspectives and moments.</p>
    
            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>I'm currently studying <strong>Management Engineering at the University of Waterloo</strong>. While my studies focus on 
               problem-solving, data analysis, and optimizing systems, photography gives me a way to step back, appreciate the world, 
               and express my creativity outside of academics.</p>
    
            <h3>The Gear I Use</h3>
            <p>I started my photography journey with the <strong>iPhone SE 2020</strong>, experimenting with lighting, composition, and framing. 
               As my interest grew, I upgraded to the <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>, which allows me to capture high-quality images with 
               improved dynamic range, sharpness, and low-light performance.</p>
            <p>In the future, after graduating, I plan to upgrade to a <strong>proper DSLR or mirrorless camera</strong> to take my photography 
               to the next level, exploring more advanced features, lenses, and manual settings.</p>
    
            <h3>What I Love to Capture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>ðŸŒ† <strong>Cityscapes & Urban Photography</strong> â€“ The energy of streets, architecture, and city life.</li>
                <li>ðŸŒ¿ <strong>Nature & Landscapes</strong> â€“ Peaceful forests, mountain views, and breathtaking scenery.</li>
                <li>ðŸŒ§ <strong>Rain & Reflections</strong> â€“ The moodiness of wet streets, puddles, and mirrored cityscapes.</li>
                <li>ðŸŒ‡ <strong>Sunsets & Golden Hour</strong> â€“ The warm, dramatic lighting of sunrise and sunset.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Editing Process</h3>
            <p>I use <strong>Adobe Lightroom Free</strong> to enhance my shots by adjusting lighting, contrast, and color grading, ensuring that 
               each photo has a balanced and visually appealing finish while staying true to the original scene.</p>
    
            <h3>Future Travel & Photography Goals</h3>
            <p>One of my dreams is to travel to some of the most <strong>beautiful and mountainous regions in the world</strong> to capture breathtaking landscapes. 
               Some of the places Iâ€™d love to visit and photograph one day include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ <strong>Japan</strong> â€“ The blend of ancient temples, neon-lit cities, and stunning mountain scenery.</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· <strong>South Korea</strong> â€“ A mix of modern architecture, traditional palaces, and scenic coastal landscapes.</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º <strong>Dagestan</strong> â€“ The dramatic mountain ranges, deep gorges, and unique cultural landscapes.</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ <strong>Switzerland</strong> â€“ Famous for the <strong>Swiss Alps</strong>, serene lakes, and charming villages.</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ <strong>Canadian Rockies</strong> â€“ Stunning mountain landscapes in <strong>Banff, Jasper, and Yoho National Parks</strong>.</li>
                <li>ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· <strong>Patagonia (Argentina & Chile)</strong> â€“ A dream destination for photographing rugged peaks, glaciers, and vast open landscapes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These places inspire me, and I hope to one day explore them with a proper camera in hand, capturing their unique beauty and atmosphere.</p>
    
            <h3>Future Plans â€“ A Camera, A Motorcycle & A Cat</h3>
            <p>Beyond photography, another big goal of mine is to <strong>get a motorcycle</strong>. The idea of riding through open roads, 
               exploring new places, and experiencing that sense of freedom is something I look forward to in the near future.</p>
            <p>I also plan to <strong>get a cat</strong> because I love animals and want a companion that I can take amazing photos of. 
               One of my goals is to <strong>take pictures of my cat and my motorcycle</strong>â€”capturing both their unique beauty in creative and exciting ways.</p>
            <p>Along with photography, I want to <strong>ride my motorcycle</strong> to new places, explore scenic routes, and enjoy the adventure that comes with it. 
               Combining my love for photography with travel and motorcycles is something Iâ€™m really looking forward to!</p>
            <p>But thatâ€™s not all. I also plan to <strong>live with my best buddy Kyumars</strong>, and together, weâ€™re going to make it legendary. 
               We plan to <strong>get motorcycles, adopt cats</strong>, and <strong>commit traffic violations on our motorcycles together</strong> (no homo, of course). 
               Speeding down highways, dodging traffic laws, and living life on the edgeâ€”itâ€™s all part of the plan. 
               Nothing too reckless, just enough to make it fun and unforgettable.</p>
