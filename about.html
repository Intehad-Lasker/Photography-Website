              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Bazz</strong>, a passionate photographer who loves capturing the beauty of the world through my lens. 
                 While photography is just a hobby for me, itâ€™s a creative escape that allows me to explore different perspectives and moments.</p>

              <h2>My Background</h2>
              <p>I'm currently studying <strong>Management Engineering at the University of Waterloo</strong>. While my studies focus on 
                 problem-solving, data analysis, and optimizing systems, photography gives me a way to step back, appreciate the world, 
                 and express my creativity outside of academics.</p>

          <section class="about-section">
              <h2>The Gear I Use</h2>
              <p>I started my photography journey with the <strong>iPhone SE 2020</strong>, experimenting with lighting, composition, and framing. 
                 As my interest grew, I upgraded to the <strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>, which allows me to capture high-quality images with 
                 improved dynamic range, sharpness, and low-light performance.</p>
              <p>In the future, after graduating, I plan to upgrade to a <strong>proper DSLR or mirrorless camera</strong> to take my photography 
                 to the next level, exploring more advanced features, lenses, and manual settings.</p>

              <h2>Future Travel & Photography Goals</h2>
              <p>One of my dreams is to travel to some of the most <strong>beautiful and mountainous regions in the world</strong> to capture breathtaking landscapes.

              <h2>Future Plans â€“ A Camera, A Motorcycle & A Cat</h2>
              <p>Beyond photography, another big goal of mine is to <strong>get a motorcycle</strong>. The idea of riding through open roads, 
                 exploring new places, and experiencing that sense of freedom is something I look forward to in the near future.</p>
              <p>I also plan to <strong>get a cat</strong> because I love animals and want a companion that I can take amazing photos of. 
                 One of my goals is to <strong>take pictures of my cat and my motorcycle</strong>â€”capturing both their unique beauty in creative and exciting ways.</p>
              <p>Along with photography, I want to <strong>ride my motorcycle</strong> to new places, explore scenic routes, and enjoy the adventure that comes with it. 
                 Combining my love for photography with travel and motorcycles is something Iâ€™m really looking forward to!</p>
              <p>But thatâ€™s not all. I also plan to <strong>live with my best buddy Kyumars</strong>, and together, weâ€™re going to make it legendary. 
                 We plan to <strong>get motorcycles, adopt cats</strong>, and <strong>commit traffic violations on our motorcycles together</strong> (no homo, of course). 
                 Speeding down highways, dodging traffic laws, and living life on the edgeâ€”itâ€™s all part of the plan. 
                 Nothing too reckless, just enough to make it fun and unforgettable.</p>
